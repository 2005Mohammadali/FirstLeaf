~~## Description~~  
~~Add a search/filter feature that allows users to search through the contributors list by name or username. This will improve the user experience when there are many contributors.~~

~~## Proposed Feature~~  
~~Add a search input box above the contributors grid that filters the displayed cards in real-time as users type.~~

~~**Good first issue** - Great for learning DOM manipulation and event handling! üîç~~
