## Description
There is an indentation issue in `assets/app.js` on line 13. The line declaring `const repo` has incorrect indentation, breaking the visual flow of the code.

## Current Code (Lines 11-14)
```javascript
                const owner = location.hostname.split('.')[0];
                const parts = location.pathname.split('/').filter(Boolean);
            const repo = parts[0] || 'firstleaf';
                return `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}`;
```

## Expected Code (Lines 11-14)
```javascript
                const owner = location.hostname.split('.')[0];
                const parts = location.pathname.split('/').filter(Boolean);
                const repo = parts[0] || 'firstleaf';
                return `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}`;
```
